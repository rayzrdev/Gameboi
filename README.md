> A simple Discord bot made for Discord Hack Week 2019 with a plethora of small games you can play, as well as a global currency and shop system!

**Gameboi** aims to be not only a cool entry for the **Discord Hack Week** of 2019, but also aims to be a full feature game bot to bring a new level of fun and games to your server!

With 2 multiplayer games (Fight & Connect 4) and 2 singleplayer games (Hangman & 2048), Gameboi is sure to liven up any server, and the charm of its retro pixel-art graphics feels right at home to any old-school gamer.

Head down to [Screenshots](#screenshots) for some screenshots of Gameboi in action! :)

## Invite

Click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=593090553856524298&permissions=8192) to invite the bot to your server!

You can also join the [official RayzrDev server](https://rayzr.dev/join) to play with Gameboi yourself :)

## Download

You can download and run the bot yourself by grabbing the latest JAR from [the RayzrDev Jenkins server here](https://ci.rayzr.dev/job/Gameboi). Simply run the JAR from the commandline like so:
