> A simple Discord bot made for Discord Hack Week 2019 with a plethora of small games you can play, as well as a global currency and shop system!

**Gameboi** aims to be not only a cool entry for the **Discord Hack Week** of 2019, but also aims to be a full feature game bot to bring a new level of fun and games to your server!

With 2 multiplayer games (Fight & Connect 4) and 2 singleplayer games (Hangman & 2048), Gameboi is sure to liven up any server, and the charm of its retro pixel-art graphics feels right at home to any old-school gamer.

Head down to [Screenshots](#screenshots) for some screenshots of Gameboi in action! :)

## Invite

Click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=593090553856524298&permissions=8192) to invite the bot to your server!

You can also join the [official RayzrDev server](https://rayzr.dev/join) to play with Gameboi yourself :)

## Run

You can download and run the bot yourself by grabbing the latest JAR from [the RayzrDev Jenkins server here](https://ci.rayzr.dev/job/Gameboi). Simply run the JAR from the commandline like so:

```bash
java -jar gameboi-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

A `config.yml` file will be generated in the working directory the first time you run the bot, so just fill in your bot token and prefix and you're good to go!

Alternatively, you can run using the [rayzr522/gameboi](https://hub.docker.com/r/rayzr522/gameboi) Docker image:

```bash
# create the data directory
mkdir data

# run the container with the data directory mounted
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/data:/var/gameboi rayzr522/gameboi

# or if you want it to run in the background and not be removed after it exits
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/var/gameboi rayzr522/gameboi
```
